# Predictive-Modeling-Using-R-Bridge-
Created using Jup Notebooks analyzing Arc files in python.
#This prediction model use a random forest prediction model to determine where conditions support growth. 
#Then, you will import the results it into ArcGIS Pro to find where the highest density of growth is likely to occur.
This framework provides the basic componets of training a script, migratig the output in to ArcPro, to determine predictions.
